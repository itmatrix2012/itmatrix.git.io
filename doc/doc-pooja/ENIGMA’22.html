              <h2>ENIGMA’22</h2>
              <h5>Date:17/03/2022</h5>
            <p> On the 17th of march 2022, the department of BCA hosted an intra collegiate IT Quiz competition, ENIGMA’22 - unveil the mystery.
              The participants began to pile up for the registration by 9:30 am at the registration desk where each team were given a code number that would represent their team in the competition. As priorly informed, the event commenced by 10 a.m with our host, Ms. Malavika welcoming the participants.
              The first round which was the preliminary round consisted of 26 teams where each team per class consisted of 2 members. There were a total of 3 rounds for the competition. Rules for each round were already well explained to the participants in the whatsapp group which was created beforehand.</p>
              <p>The first round was a basic general quiz round. It had a total of 50 questions and was evaluated on an OMR sheet. By the end of the round 11 teams were eliminated and 15 teams remained.
                The second round consisted of two levels. The first level consists of two segments, master typing and googly doodle. In the master typing, the participants speed and accuracy in typing is calculated using a a computer program. The participants who types fast with the least errors scores. Whereas in googly doodle, the participants are to identify the specials days based on their google doodles. By the end of this level, 5 more teams were eliminated and 10 remained. Onto the second level, we have parts identification, reasoning and puzzle. Parts identification is the identification of different parts of a motherboard and other parts of a computer. Next is a logical reasoning round. It contains different types of reasoning questions which are intended to judge analytical and logical reasoning skills of the participants. The participants are required to read and understand the given text or paragraph and accordingly choose the right answer from the given options. And lastly a puzzle round in which the participants are supposed to solve a puzzle within a given time period. By the end of this level, 5 more teams were eliminated and 5 remained.</p>
                <p>The third and the final round then began with the 5 finalist teams. This round consisted of 5 fun and exciting segments. The first segment being a logo identification round where each team were given a set of famous logos to be identified within a given time period. Next, was a person identification round where photos of prominent people’s childhood were displayed on the screen and the team that recognise them were to press the buzzer. In the next level, clues based on a certain person/thing were displayed on the screen and participants were supposed to connect the dots and come to a final answer. Then comes an audio-visual round where certain audios/videos  were played and team that recognises the audio/video were to press the buzzer. The final level of the final round was a rapid fire. Here, each team were given 5 questions to answer one after the other within a time limit of 30 seconds.</p>
                <p>By the end of this round we had a clear winner infront of us, Meghna and Ashwanth from 3rd year Bsc physics and runners up Abhai P and Nived AV from 1st year Msc physics. For the award ceremony, we had some honourable guests like Jouhar sir, Ratheesh sir, Remya ma’am and Bindu ma’am , join us to make the event even more auspicious and memorable. Each of the special guests took time out of their busy schedules to congratulate the participants and winners of the events with a small speech. Shortly after, the winning team was awarded with a cash prize of ₹1000 and a momento. Next, the runners up were awarded with a cash prize of ₹750 and a momento. Followed by honouring the remaining 3 teams with a memento. Participation certificates were awarded to each and every of the participants for their active participation.
                  The event commenced by 3:30pm with a vote of speech from our dearest HOD, Ms.Reshma, where she expressed her heartfelt gratitude to the chief guests, participants and her team of teachers and students who worked behind the scenes to make this event a big success.</p>
